    <h1>Outlands Roleplaying Guild Directory</h1>

    <p>Outlands is home to a rapidly growing roleplaying community. Here are some guilds we can look forward to interacting with.</p>

    <h2>Boulderfist Ork Clan [Ork]</h2>

    <p>
      The Boulderfist Orc Clan is a role playing guild focused on PvP and PvM, shiny loot, and wildly over exaggerated tales of badassery. We will most likely be found at choke points and crossroads hassling the newbies for their shoes and dirt napping when the gank squad comes. Think of us as slightly smarter mobs. I said slightly! There we go. We've been a clan for nearly a decade now and are always looking for fresh pugs to train to replace those that have been called away to that far off land of torture and bills (Real life).
    </p>

    <p>Just remember, offer tribute or become the tribute!</p>

    <h2>The Blackstone Company [TBC]</h2>

    <p>The Blackstone Company is a mercenary guild. We are a group of fighters in search of fortune and glory against all odds and all opposition.</p>

    <h2>Clan Ulfhednar [VKNG]</h2>

    <p>Jarl Harek of Clan Ulfhednar is now hearing blade oaths from any man willing to fight for his share of glory and wealth! Fight for what you want, earn it with your blood! Paradise is only for the brave and strong!</p>

    <p>[VKNG] Is recruiting! We are looking for laid back players who enjoy PvM and a little PvP. We're mature, and respectful. So no Drama Llama! We are a RP guild. Which means that sometimes our avatars talk kind've funny and don't use :D or "LoL" But we talk normal in guild chat and party chat.  We love to crawl through dungeons and split the loot. We are REALLY Enjoying the seafaring system. We've enjoyed a little sparring with the Orcs, and defending against Reds. We're hoping to see more PvP with Conquest soon!  So if you're looking for a laidback group to enjoy this server with, come and play with us. You don't have to be special to be in a roleplay guild. Just respectful. Message me @[VKNG]Astrid to discuss joining our discord and becoming a part of our Clan.</p>

    <h2>Exile Company [Ex]</h2>

    <p>The [Ex]ile Company are a band of mercenaries, who joined together as a rag tag crew, different personalities, different origins, all ready to lay down their sword for one another.</p>

    <h2>Imperium Prevalia [Prev]</h2>
    
    <p>Attention all! [Prev] Imperium Prevalia is seeking all true citizens of the Prevalian Empire to join the cause of reforming the greater empire. It was not long ago when Prevlia held sway over the entire known world and Imperium Prevalia is seeking to restore Pax Prevalia. We are accepting all manner of citizens; those who craft and trade, adventurers and of course we are looking for able bodied soldiers to fill out the ranks of the Legion and Navy.

    <p>We are a lite RP guild based on the late Roman period, we are not hardcore about the RP and if you are new to that aspect of the game we look forward to helping out anyone who wants to learn. Our legion and navy portions of the guild will focus on PVP and our citizen section will be open to all manner of play styles; PVM, crafting, fishing etc. Please message me if you have any questions or jump in our discord.</p>
