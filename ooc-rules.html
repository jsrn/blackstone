    <h1>The Blackstone Company OOC Rules</h1>

    <h2>Our Pledge</h2>

    <p>In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as players pledge to making participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.</p>

    <h2>Our Standards</h2>

    <p>Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:</p>

    <ul class="attire-list">
      <li>Using welcoming and inclusive language</li>
      <li>Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences</li>
      <li>Gracefully accepting constructive criticism</li>
      <li>Focusing on what is best for the community</li>
      <li>Showing empathy towards other community members</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:</p>

    <ul class="attire-list">
      <li>The use of overly sexual language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances</li>
      <li>Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks</li>
      <li>Public or private harassment</li>
      <li>Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission</li>
      <li>Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a casual/friendly setting</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Responsibilities</h2>

    <p>I am responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and am expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.</p>

    <p>I have the right to remove any player for behaviors that I deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.</p>

    <h2>Scope</h2>

    <p>This Code of Conduct applies anywhere. Acting like a jerk in other Discords still makes you a jerk.</p>

    <h2>Enforcement</h2>

    <p>Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting me on Discord at `Armitage Shanks#7063`. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. I am obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.</p>
